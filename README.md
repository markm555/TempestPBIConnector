# TempestPBIConnector

This repository contains a custom Power BI connector that will pull historical data from you Weatherflow Tempest Weather Station and load it into Power BI where you can create reports about your data.

The Readme.PDF file contains detailed instructions about how to use this connector and details about how it works.

This connector is offered to you free of charge and there is no support offered for this connector.  I have included the full source code as well as the compiled .Mez so you can begin using this connector without having to build it. 
Just copy the .Mez file to your "C:\Users\<your user>\Power BI Desktop\Custom Connectors", open Power BI desktop click on Get Data and type in Tempest, select the connector and follow the instruction in the Readme file.
